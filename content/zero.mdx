## Neon Cold Starts, defined

In the context of scaling to zero, cold starts represent an inherent tradeoff. After scaling down to zero, costs become nonexistent or zero. Yet, scaling up again introduces a small but perceptible latency, known as the cold-start problem.

At Neon, databases scale down computing resources to save costs after five minutes of inactivity. As a result, this process introduces latency for the following query during the cold start; once it is scaled up, the latency returns to normal.
