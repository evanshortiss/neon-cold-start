## Benchmark methodology

The benchmark sets up six different branch configurations in the same region (us-east) that vary by database size, number of extensions, and query operation (`GROUP BY` vs. `SELECT`). For each branch, an AWS Lambda executes a benchmark every 30 minutes by querying a suspended endpoint. If the endpoint is active, the Lambda suspends the branch's endpoint before initiating the benchmark. The benchmark time is measured by the duration it takes to return a query.
