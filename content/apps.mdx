## Benchmark methodology

* Sets up different branch configurations:
    * According to database size.
    * According to the number of extensions.
    * Based on query operation (`GROUP BY` vs `SELECT`.)
* Runs a benchmark query from an AWS Lambda every 30 minutes.
* Ensures that the compute endpoint is suspended before running a benchmark.
