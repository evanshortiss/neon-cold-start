## Benchmark methodology

The benchmark sets up six different branch configurations in the same region (us-east),
using different database sizes, numbers of extensions, and query operations (GROUP BY vs. SELECT).
For each branch, an AWS Lambda executes a benchmark every 30 minutes.
The benchmark itself consists of measuring the response time for a query against the target branch while it is in a suspended state.
If the branch is warm, the Lambda suspends the branch's endpoint before the benchmark.
