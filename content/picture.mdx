## Cold Starts and Scale to Zero: The bigger picture
</div>

Scale to zero is one feature of a larger technology breakthrough: Separation of storage and compute. It’s not just about shutting down and starting up gracefully though, it’s about decoupling the database from individual servers without incurring massive costs in the process. (Other databases like Cockroach, PlanetScale, Yugabyte decouple, but were built with FANG-scale workloads in mind, and run at a much larger overhead.) Decoupling storage and compute allows for lots of benefits:
